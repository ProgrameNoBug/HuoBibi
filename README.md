Before you start running the project, make sure you have the following software or environment installed on your computer
1.	Eclipse for java EE
2.	Tomcat 9 or or higher version
3.	JDK 12 or higher version
4.	MySQL8 or Higher version
5.	Java Database Connectivity 8
Both the code used for the software and the database used for the test have been provided in Git. Please download the code and import it into Eclipse. Please import the database into the local MySQL of the computer to ensure that the computer can run the program.
Also, before running the project, you need to do a few things to the code to ensure that the database is the corresponding local database on the computer: 
You need to change the String Name to the MySQL user name of the local computer.
You need to change the String code to the MySQL user password of the local computer.
You also need to change the database name to implement code to connect to the local database.
When everything is ready, you can click the mainpage.html in webapp. Then click the right mouse button, choose “Run As”, Select “Run on Server” (Make sure tomcat is available unless it can’t run as a web-app) Then the site runs on the local Tomcat server, and you can browse and manipulate the site.
